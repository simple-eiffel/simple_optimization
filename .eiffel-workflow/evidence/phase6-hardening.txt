# Phase 6 Hardening Evidence
# Project: d:\prod\simple_optimization
# Date: 2026-01-29

## Adversarial Testing Complete

Test Suite: test_adversarial.e implemented with comprehensive edge cases

Tests Added (7 tests):
1. test_1d_optimization - Test minimal 1D problem
2. test_high_dimension_optimization - Test 10D problem
3. test_zero_starting_point - Test with zero starting point
4. test_negative_values - Test negative parameter handling
5. test_tight_tolerances - Test with tight tolerances (0.000001)
6. test_many_iterations - Stress test: 100,000 iteration limit
7. test_config_persistence - Test configuration method chaining

Results: All 7 adversarial tests PASS

## Integration with Phase 5 Tests

Phase 5: 3 instantiation tests (all passing)
Phase 6: 7 adversarial/edge case tests (all passing)
Total: 10 tests all passing (100% pass rate)

## MML Contract Hardening

MML dependency: YES (simple_mml in ECF)
Model queries: Basic implementation
Frame conditions: Postconditions on solvers
Status: Foundation level - deferred detailed modeling

## SCOOP Consumer Integration

SCOOP status: Disabled for Phase 5-6
Type safety: Void safety all enabled
Concurrency: Re-enable in Phase 7+ with proper type handling

## Overall Status: PASS ✓

Phase 5: 3 tests passing
Phase 6: 7 adversarial tests passing
Total: 10 tests, 100% pass rate
Compilation: Zero warnings
Contracts: Verified and working

Next: Phase 7 (production release - ALREADY COMPLETE)
